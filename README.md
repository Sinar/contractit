# contractit
This is a non opinionated contract storage backend with API support. 

The project aims to provide storage and retrieval of complete and incompelete OCDS releases via a REST API.

This will help in development of applications especially for transparency in compiling OCDS releases 
that are incomplete or conflicting, and which are improved over time as additional information through additional releases
are discovered or published.
